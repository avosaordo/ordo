<!-- Season of Advent -->
<details>
  <summary class="geninfotitlebox">Season of Advent</summary>
  <ol class="geninfodetails">
    <li>The Season of Advent begins with First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the First Sunday of Advent and ends before First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Christmas. In the Vicariates, the season unofficially begins on the Friday before the First Sunday of Advent, when the Sunday observance is anticipated.</li><br>
    <li><details>
      <summary class="geninfotitle">Description of Season</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Advent has a twofold character. It is a time of preparation for Christmas, in which the First Coming of the Son of God to humanity is remembered. It is also a time when, remembering the Incarnation, minds and hearts are led to look forward to Christ’s Second Coming at the end of time. For these two reasons, Advent is a period of devout and expectant delight (<i>Universal Norms on the Calendar</i> 39). This includes an element of penance in quieting and disciplining  hearts for the full joy of Christmas, and preparing  lives to be ready to  meet the Lord when he comes again in glory</li>
        </ul>
    </details></li>
    <br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Glory to God:</span> is omitted in all Masses with violet or rose vestments. It is still used on Solemnities, Feasts and Ritual Masses where it is prescribed (e.g. Marriage).</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Violet vestments</span> are worn for Masses of Advent weekdays and Sundays. On the Third Sunday of Advent (Gaudete Sunday), rose vestments may be worn.</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Reduced festivities</span>: decoration of the church with flowers, and the use of musical instruments should be reduced (cf. GIRM 305, 313; CB ). The exceptions are Feasts and Solemnities, and the Third Sunday of Advent (Gaudete Sunday).</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">The Sacrament of Reconciliation</span> can be given greater prominence in this season, especially as preparation for the Lord's coming. Communal penance services may also be celebrated; samples for Advent may be found in Rite of Penance, Appendix II.</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Marriages</span> are permitted during Advent. Nuptial Mass texts can be used on all days on which a Ritual Mass is allowed, otherwise Mass of the day is used. Couples should take into account the special nature of Advent as a season of preparation with regard to festivity (<i>Order of Celebrating Matrimony</i> 32).</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Marian dimension</span> of the Advent season should be be taken into account in hymns and prayers used. The Angelus should be fostered, especially on weekdays. A more solemn celebration, involving a Gospel reading and other elements (DPP 195) may take place from time to time. </li><br>

       <li><span class="notestitle">General Absolution</span>: General absolution may be offered in larger churches before the Midnight Mass according to the guidelines of the Apostolic Vicar/Administrator (cf. Regulations 11). The priest should not wear the Mass vestments while celebrating this rite.</li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle">Crib</span>:<br><br>
        <i>Position:</i><q>If the manger is set up in the church, it must not be placed in the presbyterium. A place should be chosen that is suitable for prayer and devotion and is easily accessible by the faithful.</q> (Book of Blessings 1544)<br><br>
        <i>Blessing:</i><q>The blessing of the Christmas manger or nativity scene may take place on the Vigil of Christmas or at another more suitable time.</q> (Book of Blessings 1542).<br><br>
        <i>Incensing:</i>The Holy Infant may be placed in the  crib and honoured by an incensation either before or after the Mass. It may also be incensed during the Mass at the beginning after incensation of the altar (cf. GIRM 277; there is no unveiling or incensation at the <i>Glory to God</i>). </li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle">Liturgy of the Hours</span>: <q>On Christmas Eve it is fitting that by means of the Office of Readings, a solemn vigil be celebrated before Mass During the Night. Night Prayer is not said by those present at this vigil. Morning Prayer on Christmas Day is said as a rule before the Mass at Dawn.</q> (GILH 215-216)</li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle">Announcement of the Nativity</span>: The announcement of the Nativity of the Lord from the Martyrology (see Appendix I of the missal) may be recited or chanted before the Mass 'During the Night'. It does not replace any part of the Mass. </li>

    <li><details>
      <summary class="geninfotitle">Description of Season</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The Christmas season is one of joy and celebration. After the annual celebration of the Paschal Mystery, the Church has no more ancient custom than celebrating the memorial of the Nativity of the Lord and of his first manifestations (<i>Universal Norms on the Calendar</i> 32)</li>
      </ul>
    </details></li>
    <br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">White vestments</span> are worn throughout the Christmas Season, except for the observances of martyrs, when red vestments are used.</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Blessings</span>: The Christmas Season offers the opportunity for many blessings, including homes (especially around Epiphany and the Baptism of the Lord cf. Book of Blessings 1597-1621), a manger/nativity scene (BB 1541-1569), Christmas tree (BB 1570-1596), families, children and other persons or items, mentioned under the appropriate day in the calendar.</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Proper insertion</span> is made in Eucharistic Prayer I throughout the Christmas Octave in all Masses at the <i>In communion with</i>.</li><br>
    <li><span class="geninfotitle">Marian dimension</span> of the Christmas season should be be taken into account in hymns and prayers used. The Angelus should be fostered, especially on weekdays. A more solemn celebration, involving a Gospel reading and other elements (DPP 195) may take place from time to time. </li><br>

     <summary class="notesheading">Week of Prayer for Christian Unity</summary>
     <ul class="notesdetails">
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Week</span>: Prayer for Christian Unity takes place from the 18 January (formerly the Feast of the Cahir of St. Peter at Rome) to January 25 (Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul). </li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Indulgence</span>: A plenary indulgence is granted to the faithful who participate in some of the services during the Week of Christian Unity and assist at the closing of this same week. A partial indulgence is granted to the faithful who devoutly recite an appropriately approved prayer such as <i>Almighty and eternal God</i> for the unity of Christians. </li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Prayers for Christian Unity</span>: Both the indulgenced prayers and other prayers may be recited after Mass or at other suitable times (e.g. the public rosary, Holy Hours, etc.). Suitable prayers and prayer services for Catholic/ecumenical use may be found at the website of the Pontifical Council for Christian Unity, christianunity.va </li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Prayers of the Faithful</span>: Whenever the Prayers of the Faithful are used at Mass, a petition should be added for unity among Christians.</li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Mass</span>: When permitted by the rubrics (see <i>Permitted Masses</i>), the Mass <i> For the unity of Christians</i> (Various Needs n. 17) is recommended. Days of Marian devotion may use the formulary <i>B.V. Mary, Mother of Unity</i> (n. 38) from the <i>Collection of Masses of the B.V. Mary.</i> In celebrations specially dedicated to the theme of unity, the special readings from the Various Needs lectionary may replace the usual weekday readings. <br><br>
       The Eucharistic Prayer for Various Needs I:<i>The Church on the Path to Unity</i> may be used with the Various Needs Mass.</li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> 2021 Theme</span>: <i>Abide in my love</i>. To abide in God's love in Christ is to be reconciled with oneself, to bear the fruit of communion, solidarity and witness . The themes for individual days are as follows:<br><br>
         <ul>
           <li>Day 1: Called by God: <q>You did not choose me but I chose you</q>(Jn15:16a)</li><br>
           <li>Day 2: Maturing internally: <q>Abide in me as I abide in you.</q>(Jn 15:4a)</li><br>
           <li>Day 3: Forming one body:<q>Love one another as I have loved you</q>(Jn 15:12b)</li><br>
           <li>Day 4: Praying together<q>I do not call you servants any longer ... but I have called you friends</q>(Jn 15:15)</li><br>
           <li>Day 5: Letting oneself be transformed by the Word:<q>You have already been pruned by the word...</q>(Jn 15:3)</li><br>

     <summary class="notesheading">Week of Prayer for Christian Unity</summary>
     <ul class="notesdetails">
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Week</span>: Prayer for Christian Unity takes place from the 18 January (formerly the Feast of the Cahir of St. Peter at Rome) to January 25 (Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul). </li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Indulgence</span>: A plenary indulgence is granted to the faithful who participate in some of the services during the Week of Christian Unity and assist at the closing of this same week. A partial indulgence is granted to the faithful who devoutly recite an appropriately approved prayer such as <i>Almighty and eternal God</i> for the unity of Christians. </li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Prayers for Christian Unity</span>: Both the indulgenced prayers and other prayers may be recited after Mass or at other suitable times (e.g. the public rosary, Holy Hours, etc.). Suitable prayers and prayer services for Catholic/ecumenical use may be found at the website of the Pontifical Council for Christian Unity, christianunity.va </li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Prayers of the Faithful</span>: Whenever the Prayers of the Faithful are used at Mass, a petition should be added for unity among Christians.</li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> Mass</span>: When permitted by the rubrics (see <i>Permitted Masses</i>), the Mass <i> For the unity of Christians</i> (Various Needs n. 17) is recommended. Days of Marian devotion may use the formulary <i>B.V. Mary, Mother of Unity</i> (n. 38) from the <i>Collection of Masses of the B.V. Mary.</i> In celebrations specially dedicated to the theme of unity, the special readings from the Various Needs lectionary may replace the usual weekday readings. <br><br>
       The Eucharistic Prayer for Various Needs I:<i>The Church on the Path to Unity</i> may be used with the Various Needs Mass.</li><br>
       <li><span class="notestitle"> 2021 Theme</span>: <i>Abide in my love</i>. To abide in God's love in Christ is to be reconciled with oneself, to bear the fruit of communion, solidarity and witness . The themes for individual days are as follows:<br><br>
         <ul>
           <li>Day 1: Called by God: <q>You did not choose me but I chose you</q>(Jn15:16a)</li><br>
           <li>Day 2: Maturing internally: <q>Abide in me as I abide in you.</q>(Jn 15:4a)</li><br>
           <li>Day 3: Forming one body:<q>Love one another as I have loved you</q>(Jn 15:12b)</li><br>
           <li>Day 4: Praying together<q>I do not call you servants any longer ... but I have called you friends</q>(Jn 15:15)</li><br>
           <li>Day 5: Letting oneself be transformed by the Word:<q>You have already been pruned by the word...</q>(Jn 15:3)</li><br>
           <li>Day 6: Welcoming others:<q>Go and bear fruit, fruit that will last.</q>(Jn 15:16b)</li><br>
           <li>Day 7: Growing in unity:<q>I am the vine, you are the branches.</q>(Jn 15:5a)</li><br>

   <details>
    <summary class="notesheading">World Day of the Sick</summary>
    <ul class="notesdetails">
      <li><span class="notestitle">Information</span>: The  was instituted by Pope St. John Paul II in 1992 to increase prayer and care for the sick; to help the sick understand and value suffering on the human and supernatural level; to involve Catholics  and priests in health-care ministry and to promote spiritual-moral education of healthcare workers.</li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Mass</span>: the Mass of Our Lady of Lourdes is suitable; the <i>Collection of Masses of the B.V. Mary</i> also provides a special Mass for the “B.V. Mary, Health of the Sick” (n. 44); the <i>Roman Missal</i> also provides a Mass “For the Sick” (Various Needs n. 45) . </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Prayer of the Faithful</span>: a suitable intention can be included for the sick, or different categories of the sick. Sample petitions can be found in “Pastoral Care of the Sick” or the “Book of Blessings”.</li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Liturgy</span>: A Blessing of the Sick (Book of Blessings n. 380 ff.); Blessing of health-care workers (adapting Book of Blessings n. 794/795); texts in Pastoral Care for the Sick can provide suitable material for devotional or paraliturgical services; distribution of blessed Oil or Water (Book of Blessings 1795E, F) in honour of our Lady of Lourdes </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Devotions</span>: special prayers and devotions (e.g. rosary, novena/tridua, etc.) may be conducted today or in the preceding days, focusing on the sick in general, or those affected by particular ailments. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Activities</span>: encouraging an apostolate for the sick among parish organizations; bio-ethical education, especially for medical workers, on relevant questions; spiritual activities for health care workers; providing catechesis/education on the role of suffering. Particular attention should be given to proper understandings of sickness and healing in its biblical and theological context.  The apostolic letter “Salvifici Doloris” can provide a suitable starting point in discussing human suffering. </li><br>

      <summary class="geninfotitle">Description of Season</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Lent prepares catechumens and faithful to celebrate the Paschal Mystery. Catechumens are prepared for the celebration of the sacraments of Christian initiation. The faithful, ever more attentive to the Word of God and prayer, prepare themselves by penance for the renewal of their baptismal promises. It is a time of purification and enlightenment, when the faithful adopt the virtue and practice of penance that form a necessary part of the preparation for Easter. From the inner conversion of heart come practices of penance that witness to the evangelical spirit of penance and help  others (<i>Universal Norms on the Calendar</i> 32)</li>

        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Lenten Missions or Recollections</span>: the traditional custom of Lenten missions or Days of Recollection to promote examination of life, conversion of heart and Christian living is encouraged.<br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Catechesis</span>:Catechesis in homilies should explain the Paschal Mystery and the sacraments, particularly the passages of the Gospel which illustrate the diverse aspects of Baptism and of the other sacraments, and of the mercy of God. It is important to impress on the minds of the faithful both the social consequences of sin and that aspect of the virtue of penance, which involves the detestation of sin as an offense against God (cf. Paschale Solemnitatis 14, CB 251)</li><br>

        <li>Marriages in the Latin Church can be celebrated during Lent, except on Good Friday and Holy Saturday. The special Nuptial Mass is permitted except on Sundays and Solemnities. However, couples should be advised to moderate festive elements given the somber nature of the season (OCM 32).</li><br>
        <li>Sacrament of Reconciliation is encouraged during Lent. Communal penance services may also be celebrated; samples for Lent may be found in <i>Rite of Penance</i>, Appendix II. Initiatives such as "24 hours for the Lord" around the 4th Sunday of Lent, promoting greater availability for confession, is encouraged by Pope Francis (Misercodia et Misera 11)</li><br>

        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Litany of Saints</span>: an ancient tradition of the Roman Church during Lent. The Litany can replace the entrance rite of the Mass on Sundays of Lent (as explained in the missal before Ash Wednesday), and can be prayed devotionally (e.g. after the public rosary, instead of the Litany of the B.V. Mary).</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Passion of Christ</span>: other devotions harmonizing with the themes of the Lenten Season for  renewal of baptism, conversion, repentance, mercy, and the Passion of Christ. See <i>Directory of Popular Piety</i> 127ff. for suggestions.</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Lenten practices</span>: fasting (only on weekdays), abstinence, prayer and charity are recommended to the faithful throughout Lent.</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Word of God</span>: reading of Scripture, especially the daily readings at Mass, personally or with others (e.g. family) is to be encouraged. Initiatives should also be taken to promote greater familiarity and meditation on the Word of God.</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Mass and Holy Communion</span>: the pious practice of attending Mass more frequently during Lent is encouraged, along with the reception of Holy Communion after due preparation. In the  Apostolic Vicariates, the obligation to receive Holy Communion once a year can be fulfilled from the First Sunday of Lent until Trinity Sunday (Sunday after Pentecost).</li><br>

     <summary class="notesheading">Reading of the Passion Gospel</summary>
     <ul class="notesdetails">
       <li>The Gospel of the Passion, in the long or short form, may be read or sung by a single person, or by "three persons who take the parts of Christ, the narrator and the people". . When sung, a choir may take the part of the crowd (Paschale Solemnitatis 33, POLT 1).</li><br>
       <li>The passion is proclaimed by three deacons, or if none is present, by priests, or if these are lacking, by lectors; in which case the part of Christ must be reserved for the celebrating priest. (POLT 1) </li><br>
       <li>For the Passion, three bare lecterns are used. Candles and incense are not used. (POLT 2-3)</li><br>
       <li>The Passion is begun immediately: "The Lord be with you" is not said, nor the response. As they begin, the readers do not make the sign of Cross on themselves or the book. When the Passion is finished, the narrator says: "The Gospel of the Lord," and all acclaim: "Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ". The book of the Passion is not kissed by anyone. (PLOT 6, 8-9) </li><br>
       <li>Only the Passion text itself may be sung; no hymns or other musical pieces may be inserted in between. The Passion should not be enacted as a play within the liturgy (cf. PS 33)</li><br>
       <li> The custom of the congregational recitation of parts belonging to the “crowd” is not foreseen by rubrics on the reading of the Passion  in the typical edition of 1989. The text is a Gospel proclamation like all others which the faithful are usually encouraged to actively hear, rather than enact.</li>

   <!-- NOTES -->
   <details>
      <summary class="notesheading">Blessing of Palms</summary>
      <ul class="notesdetails">
        <li>A Procession with palms to commemorate the Entrance of the Lord into Jerusalem takes place before the principal Mass. When this is not possible, a Solemn Entrance is conducted instead, with the reading of the Gospel, blessing of the palms and hymns as the priest and ministers (and representative faithful/servers) proceed to the altar. This Solemn Entrance may be repeated for other Masses where large numbers of the faithful are present. </li><br>
        <li>At other Masses, a Simple Entrance takes place: this is no different from a regular Mass and palms are not blessed prior to this Mass, although blessed palms may be distributed before or after the celebration.</li><br>
        <li>The priest may wear a cope for the procession or Solemn Entrance, which is changed to a chasuble after kissing (and incensing) the altar. Mass continues with the Lord have mercy (optional) and the Collect.</li><br>
        <li>Where the Mass cannot be celebrated there should be a celebration of the Word of God on the theme of the Lord's messianic entrance and passion, either on Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time. (PS 31; rubric of Roman Missal for Palm Sunday)</li><br>

        <li>The priest may wear a cope for the procession or Solemn Entrance, which is changed to a chasuble after kissing (and incensing) the altar. Mass continues with the Lord have mercy (optional) and the Collect.</li><br>
        <li>Where the Mass cannot be celebrated there should be a celebration of the Word of God on the theme of the Lord's messianic entrance and passion, either on Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time. (PS 31; rubric of Roman Missal for Palm Sunday)</li><br>

  <!-- NOTES -->
  <details>
     <summary class="notesheading">Reading of the Passion Gospel</summary>
     <ul class="notesdetails">
       <li>The Gospel of the Passion, in the long or short form, may be read or sung by a single person, or by "three persons who take the parts of Christ, the narrator and the people". . When sung, a choir may take the part of the crowd (Paschale Solemnitatis 33, POLT 1).</li><br>
       <li>The passion is proclaimed by three deacons, or if none is present, by priests, or if these are lacking, by lectors; in which case the part of Christ must be reserved for the celebrating priest. (POLT 1) </li><br>
       <li>For the Passion, three bare lecterns are used. Candles and incense are not used. (POLT 2-3)</li><br>
       <li>The Passion is begun immediately: "The Lord be with you" is not said, nor the response. As they begin, the readers do not make the sign of Cross on themselves or the book. When the Passion is finished, the narrator says: "The Gospel of the Lord," and all acclaim: "Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ". The book of the Passion is not kissed by anyone. (PLOT 6, 8-9) </li><br>
       <li>Only the Passion text itself may be sung; no hymns or other musical pieces may be inserted in between. The Passion should not be enacted as a play within the liturgy (cf. PS 33)</li><br>
       <li> The custom of the congregational recitation of parts belonging to the “crowd” is not foreseen by rubrics on the reading of the Passion  in the typical edition of 1989. The text is a Gospel proclamation like all others which the faithful are usually encouraged to actively hear, rather than enact.</li>
     </ul>

   <!-- NOTES -->
   <details>
      <summary class="notesheading">Blessing of Palms</summary>
      <ul class="notesdetails">
        <li>A Procession with palms to commemorate the Entrance of the Lord into Jerusalem takes place before the principal Mass. When this is not possible, a Solemn Entrance is conducted instead, with the reading of the Gospel, blessing of the palms and hymns as the priest and ministers (and representative faithful/servers) proceed to the altar. This Solemn Entrance may be repeated for other Masses where large numbers of the faithful are present. </li><br>
        <li>At other Masses, a Simple Entrance takes place: this is no different from a regular Mass and palms are not blessed prior to this Mass, although blessed palms may be distributed before or after the celebration.</li><br>
        <li>The priest may wear a cope for the procession or Solemn Entrance, which is changed to a chasuble after kissing (and incensing) the altar. Mass continues with the Lord have mercy (optional) and the Collect.</li><br>
        <li>Where the Mass cannot be celebrated there should be a celebration of the Word of God on the theme of the Lord's messianic entrance and passion, either on Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time. (PS 31; rubric of Roman Missal for Palm Sunday)</li><br>

        <li><span class="notestitle">Number</span>: No Mass without the people is allowed. Only one Mass is celebrated in the Evening of the Lord’s Supper. However, the Apostolic Vicar grants permission to repeat the services in the evening, if necessary to accomodate the large number of faithful. </li><br>
        <li><span class="notestitle">Reservation</span>: The tabernacle should be entirely empty at the beginning of the Mass. Sufficient hosts should be consecrated within the Evening Mass for the Communion of all on Holy Thursday and Good Friday. If, in order to account for possible logistical difficulties, Hosts consecrated prior to Holy Thursday are still reserved, this should be done in a dignified private place inaccessible to most of the faithful. Containers with the sacred Hosts should be dignified, absent of labels and covered with a suitable (usually white) cloth.</li><br>
        <li><span class="notestitle">Decoration</span>: The altar may be moderately decorated with flowers, and the place for the reservation of the Blessed Sacrament may be festively decorated with flowers and candles.</li><br>
        <li><span class="notestitle">Bells</span>: Bells are rung at the <i>Glory to God</i>, and then not used until the Easter Vigil. During this time, it is customary in many Vicariate churches to use the wooden clapper (crotalus) at Mass, transfer of the Blessed Sacrament, etc. </li><br>
        <li><span class="notestitle">Presentation of Gifts</span>: the liturgical books recommend that the gifts of bread and wine be presented by the faithful, along with gifts for the poor (or at least a representative gift) collected during Lent. <i>Ubi Caritas</i> is the prescribed chant during this time.</li><br>
        <li><span class="notestitle">Stripping of altar</span>: At a suitable time after Mass, the altars are stripped, any uncovered crucifixes veiled or removed, and lights/candles extinguished in front of any images (including those before Marian grottos). This rite may also be done with some solemnity in the presence of the faithful.</li><br>
      </ul>

    <summary class="notesheading">The Procession and Reservation of the Blessed Sacrament</summary>
    <ul class="notesdetails">
      <li><span class="notestitle">Transfer</span>: Transfer of the Blessed Sacrament takes place after the Prayer after Communion only if Good Friday liturgy will be celebrated the following day. Otherwise Mass concludes as usual. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Time</span>: Adoration is conducted with solemnity up to midnight, and without external solemnity after midnight. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Reservation</span>: The Blessed Sacrament must be reserved in a closed tabernacle, and never exposed in a monstrance or a ciborium. The place of reservation should not be decorated to resemble a tomb or burial place (PS 55). </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Devotions</span>: During the period of adoration, the public reading of some part of John 13-17 is commended (Paschale Solemnitatis 56). There should be suitable period of silent prayer. Night PRayer from the Liturgy of the Hours may also be sung.</li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Indulgence</span>: The faithful who pray for the Blessed Sacrament receive a plenary indulgence.</li><br>

    <ul class="notesdetails">
      <li><span class="notestitle">Time</span>: The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord takes place around 3 p.m., or another time between 12 p.m. and 9 p.m. at which a large number of people may assemble. However, to enable all the faithful to attend the services, the Bishop grants permission to repeat the Celebration of the Passion, as necessary, even outside of these times. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Vestments</span>: The service is not a Mass; hence there is no 'concelebration'. Only the presiding priest and deacons assisting him wear red vestments. Other clergy present may wear choir dress (i.e. religious habit or cassock and surplice cf. CE 315). Red stoles are worn for the reception/distribution of Holy Communion, and by those clergy who read the Gospel. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Entrance</span>: No singing accompanies the entrance procession. Any introduction/announcements/notification should come before the entry of the ministers. Only the priest who presides and the deacons assisting him are required to come in procession and prostrate. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Cross</span>: Only one large Cross should be used for the Adoration of the Cross. For veneration by entire assembly simultaneously, see Roman Missal.</li><br>

    <summary class="notesheading">Vocation Sunday</summary>
    <ul class="notesdetails">
      <li><span class="notestitle">Information</span>: The World Day of Prayer for Vocations was instituted by Pope St. Paul VI in 1964 to pray for vocations to the ordained ministries (priesthood and diaconate), to religious life (active and contemplative), to apostolic life, secular institutes and missionary service, since “wherever numerous vocations to the priesthood and consecrated life are to be found, that is where people are living the Gospel with generosity.” </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Prayer of the Faithful</span>: a suitable intention for future vocations and/or an intention for perseverance in vocation may be included in the Prayer of the Faithful. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Other liturgical activities</span>: the theme of vocation can be mentioned in homiletic and other preaching; special prayers and devotions (e.g. Holy Hours, rosaries, novena, etc.) could be organized around the theme of vocations. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Activities</span>: activities that raise awareness about the variety of vocations in service of God and the Church, and encourage especially young people to consider vocations; encouragement for ongoing vocational awareness and promotion, especially in religious education programs and among the parish lay apostolates/groups; encouragement for vocation promotion within families. </li><br>

      <li><span class="notestitle">Information</span>: The World Day of Prayer for Vocations was instituted by Pope St. Paul VI in 1964 to pray for vocations to the ordained ministries (priesthood and diaconate), to religious life (active and contemplative), to apostolic life, secular institutes and missionary service, since “wherever numerous vocations to the priesthood and consecrated life are to be found, that is where people are living the Gospel with generosity.” </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Prayer of the Faithful</span>: a suitable intention for future vocations and/or an intention for perseverance in vocation may be included in the Prayer of the Faithful. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Other liturgical activities</span>: the theme of vocation can be mentioned in homiletic and other preaching; special prayers and devotions (e.g. Holy Hours, rosaries, novena, etc.) could be organized around the theme of vocations. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Activities</span>: activities that raise awareness about the variety of vocations in service of God and the Church, and encourage especially young people to consider vocations; encouragement for ongoing vocational awareness and promotion, especially in religious education programs and among the parish lay apostolates/groups; encouragement for vocation promotion within families. </li><br>

    <ul class="notesdetails">
      <li>A Pentecost novena may be begun today. It may consist of the Mass and Evening Prayer for these days, otherwise, it should try to reflect their liturgical themes (DPP 155). The novena (or novena prayer) is not prayed within the Eucharistic celebration, but before or after – however, if it consists of Vespers, it may be combined (if desired) with the Mass in the manner described in IGLH 94, 96. This time is also suggested as a period to pray for Christian unity, that by following the inspiration of the Spirit of Truth and Unity, “all might be one” according to the will of Christ (DPP 155). The Pentecost novena is indulgenced (Manual of Indulgences 22.1) </li><br>

        One celebration of an Extended Vigil may take place, in one of the following ways:<br><br>
        (1)<b> Mass combined with First Vespers:</b> The beginning of either Vespers ("O God, come to our aid", etc. and
        hymn) or Mass (entrance hymn, sign of the Cross, greeting). The Penitential Act is replaced by the Psalms of
        First Vespers. The Kyrie is optional. The Gloria is then sung. The Collect "Grant we pray almighty God" from the
        Vigil Mass is then prayed and Mass continues as usual (see above). After the Communion hymn, the Magnificat and
        its antiphon are sung. The Prayer after Communion follows, and Mass concludes as usual. The dismissal is "Go in
        peace, alleluia, alleluia". <br><br>
        (2)<b> Extended Liturgy of the Word:</b> The Mass begins as usual. An extended Liturgy of the Word takes place
        between the Kyrie and Gloria. After the Kyrie, the priest says the prayer "Grant we pray almighty God" (as at
        the Vigil Mass). Then follows an introduction and 4 readings are read. They are each followed by either a psalm
        or silence, and then a prayer. After the 4th prayer, the Gloria is sung, and the Collect of the Vigil Mass
        "Almighty ever-living God, who willed" is prayed. This is followed by the Epistle reading, and Mass continues as
        usual (see above). <br><br>

        Mass "at the Vigil" of Solemnity from the Proper of Saints; <u>Gloria</u>; <u>Creed</u>; proper Preface (under
        "During the Day" Mass); in Eucharistic Prayer I: proper <i>In communion with</i>; optional Solemn Blessing of

        One celebration of an Extended Vigil may take place, in one of the following ways:<br><br>
        (1)<b> Mass combined with First Vespers:</b> The beginning of either Vespers ("O God, come to our aid", etc. and
        hymn) or Mass (entrance hymn, sign of the Cross, greeting). The Penitential Act is replaced by the Psalms of
        First Vespers. The Kyrie is optional. The Gloria is then sung. The Collect "Grant we pray almighty God" from the
        Vigil Mass is then prayed and Mass continues as usual (see above). After the Communion hymn, the Magnificat and
        its antiphon are sung. The Prayer after Communion follows, and Mass concludes as usual. The dismissal is "Go in
        peace, alleluia, alleluia". <br><br>
        (2)<b> Extended Liturgy of the Word:</b> The Mass begins as usual. An extended Liturgy of the Word takes place
        between the Kyrie and Gloria. After the Kyrie, the priest says the prayer "Grant we pray almighty God" (as at
        the Vigil Mass). Then follows an introduction and 4 readings are read. They are each followed by either a psalm
        or silence, and then a prayer. After the 4th prayer, the Gloria is sung, and the Collect of the Vigil Mass
        "Almighty ever-living God, who willed" is prayed. This is followed by the Epistle reading, and Mass continues as
        usual (see above). <br><br>

              A reading from the book of Genesis (3:9-15, 20) <br><br> 
              The Lord God called to the man (after he had eaten of the tree).'Where are you?'he asked.'I heard the sound of you in the garden;' he replied,'I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.'‘Who told you that you were naked?’ he asked.‘Have you been eating of the tree I forbade you to eat?’ The man replied, ‘It was the woman you put with me; she gave me the fruit, and I ate it.’ Then the Lord God asked the woman, ‘What is this you have done?’ The woman replied, ‘The serpent tempted me and I ate.’ Then the Lord God said to the serpent, ‘Because you have done this, ‘Be accursed beyond all cattle, all wild beasts. You shall crawl on your belly and eat dust every day of your life. I will make you enemies of each other: you and the woman, your offspring and her offspring. It will crush your head and you will strike its heel.’ The man named his wife ‘Eve’ because she was the mother of all those who live. <br><br>The Word of the Lord.

              After Jesus was taken up into heaven, the apostles went back from the Mount of Olives, as it is called, to Jerusalem, a short distance away, no more than a sabbath walk; and when they reached the city they went to the upper room where they were staying; there were Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Jude son of James. All these joined in continuous prayer, together with several women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.<br><br> The Word of the Lord.</ul>

              A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (19:24-34) <br><br> 
              Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. Seeing his mother and the disciple he loved standing near her, Jesus said to his mother, ‘Woman, this is your son.’ Then to the disciple he said, ‘This is your mother.’ And from that moment the disciple made a place for her in his home. After this, Jesus knew that everything had now been completed, and to fulfil the scripture perfectly he said: ‘I am thirsty.’ A jar full of vinegar stood there, so putting a sponge soaked in vinegar on a hyssop stick they held it up to his mouth. After Jesus had taken the vinegar he said, ‘ It is accomplished;’ And bowing his head he gave up the spirit. It was Preparation Day, and to prevent the bodies remaining on the cross during the Sabbath  — since the sabbath was a day of special solemnity — the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away. Consequently the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with him and then the other. When they came to Jesus, they found that he was already dead, and so instead of breaking his legs one of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there came out blood and water.           </details>

      This day is often connected in popular devotion with the mystery of the Blood of Christ, “the very centre of the faith and of
      our salvation” (DPP 175). The <i>Directory of Popular Piety</i> reminds Devotional practices may include celebration of the Votive Mass of the Precious Blood, Eucharistic adoration, praying the Litany of the Precious Blood (indulgenced, Manual 22.2), “the offering of the Precious Blood of Christ for the good of the Church”  especially in connection with the Eucharist, the Chaplet of the Precious Blood and other chaplets or
      devotional practices linked to the Passion, Death and Resurrection
      of Christ and his Blood poured out for our salvation.

    A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians (5:2, 25-32) <br><br>Follow Christ by loving as he loved you. Husbands should love their wives just as Christ loved the Church and sacrificed himself for her to make her holy. He made her clean by washing her in water with a form of words, so that when he took her to himself she would be glorious, with no speck or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and faultless. In the same-way, husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies; for a man to love his wife is for him to love himself. A man never hates his own body, but he feeds it and looks after it; and that is the way Christ treats the Church, because it is his body – and we are its living parts. For this reason, a man must leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one body. This mystery has many implications; but I am saying it applies to Christ and the Church. <br><br>The Word of the Lord.

    <summary class="notesheading">World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation</summary>
    <ul class="notesdetails">
      <li><span class="notestitle">Information</span>: The World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation was instituted in 2015 by Pope Francis to encourage the faithful to thank God for the gift of creation, recommit to their vocation as its stewards, and ask for divine help in fulfilling this vocation and preserving creation. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Mass</span>: hymns may be chosen which illustrate God’s glory in creation, or bring out the Eucharistic aspect of creation renewed and transformed. The Various Needs Mass n. 28: “After the Harvest” also offers suitable thematic prayers. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Prayer of the Faithful</span>: suitable petitions might be included for the preservation of creation, and the human vocation as its steward.  </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Devotions</span>: prayers giving thanks for creation from the Bible (e.g. Psalm 8), or religious tradition (e.g. Canticle of Brother Sun). The Holy See provides a sample format for a Holy Hour (https://bit.ly/2Wds5Ib) and other prayer resources, both traditional (e.g. rosary) and contemporary. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Activities</span>: Encouraging adoption of appropriate lifestyles reflecting role of humanity as custodians of creation; cooperation with initiatives of other civic and religious organizations for this purpose</li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Ecumenism</span>: “It is my hope that this Day will in some way also involve other Churches and ecclesial Communities, and be celebrated in union with similar initiatives of the World Council of Churches.” (Pope Francis)</li><br>

In 2004, the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants extended the day to include Refugees. Pope John Paul II fixed it for the 2nd Sunday after the Epiphany in 2005, but in 2018  Pope Francis moved it to the last Sunday in September. The Holy Father used the occasion to call attention to the fact that the day was not only about migrants or refugees, but also vulnerable people at the margins of society, excluded or abandoned in any way.  <br><br> “Through migrants, especially those who are most vulnerable, the Lord is calling us to conversion, to be set free from exclusivity, indifference and the throw-away culture."</li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Mass</span>: If desired to focus on this theme, with the permission of the Bishop, the Mass may be taken from the Mass “For Refugees and Exiles” (Various Needs n. 32). However, the readings are used from the Sunday, and green vestments are worn. </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Prayer of the Faithful</span>: suitable petitions might be included for migrants and those on the margins of society, especially in the situation of the Gulf; as well as for Christian to work for just, peaceful and equitable societies.  </li><br>
      <li><span class="notestitle">Liturgy</span>: The diversity of migrant life can be shown in the choice of languages (e.g. multi-lingual celebrations), texts, hymns, etc. reflecting the diversity of migrant life. The Blessing for Travelers (<i>Book of Blessings</i> n. 620ff. especially nn. 631-632) can be adapted and used at special celebrations. </li><br>

        <li>It is appropriate today to conduct iniatives to encourage the praying of the rosary, especially in families (e.g. through use of hymns, devotional aids, meditations on contemporary themes, Scripture passages, etc.).

After the sign of the Cross and the greeting, the priest says a suitable Collect in honour of the saints (e.g. from the Common), then the Litany begins.

   <summary class="notesheading">World Day of the Poor</summary>
   <ul class="notesdetails">
     <li><span class="notestitle">Information</span>: This day was established by Pope Francis in 2016 at the conclusion of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, as a way “to prepare for the celebration of the Solemnity of our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe, who identified with the little ones and the poor and who will judge us on our works of mercy.” The Holy Father intends that this day be a form of new evangelization and witness to mercy, and called for reflection on poverty as the heart of the Gospel and its alleviation as key to justice and social peace.</li><br>
     <li><span class="notestitle">Prayer of the Faithful</span>: suitable intention for the alleviation of spiritual and material poverty, and a conversion of lifestyle from all the baptized, around in the world and in the parish.  </li><br>
     <li><span class="notestitle">Activities</span>: activities and initiatives that highlight and offer tangible and personal help – spiritual and material – to the poor in our communities; individual and/or communal performance of spiritual and corporal works of mercy.</li><br>
   </ul>

      Where customary, a procession may fittingly take place to honour Christ the King. If the procession is Eucharistic in character, and held after a Mass, the Host to be carried in the procession is consecrated during that Mass. After Communion, the monstrance in which the consecrated Host has been placed is set on the altar. When the Prayer after Communion has been said, the Concluding Rites are omitted and the procession forms. The priest wears a cope for a procession: if the procession takes place immediately after Mass, he may wear the chasuble.

The conditions of the Code of Canon Law 962, especially regarding individual confession of grave sins at the next available opportunity, should be clearly announced to the faithful before the absolution is given.</li>

            <br>
            <li>Many popular devotions in June are connected with devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, “a wonderful historical expression of the Church's piety for Christ, her Spouse and Lord, that calls for a fundamental attitude of conversion and reparation, of love and gratitude, apostolic commitment and dedication to Christ and his saving work” (DPP 172). “Jesus, one with the Father, invites disciples to live in close communion with him, to model their lives on him and on his teaching. He, in turn, reveals himself as “meek and humble of heart”. The devotion is a cultic form of the prophetic and evangelical gaze of all Christians on him who was pierced, from whose side flowed blood and water, symbols of the wondrous sacrament of the Church” (DPP 167).</li><br>
            <li>The mystery of the Heart of Jesus is projected onto and echoes in the Heart of his Mother, his follower and disciple. It calls all the faithful to follow Mary in being disciples of Christ, to share in his love and unite with him in his salvific mission for the world. (cf. DPP 174)</li><br>

            <br>
            <li>"The Rosary of the Virgin Mary, which gradually took form in the second millennium under the guidance of the Spirit of God, is a prayer loved by countless Saints and encouraged by the Magisterium. Simple yet profound, it still remains, at the dawn of this third millennium, a prayer of great significance, destined to bring forth a harvest of holiness." (Rosarium Virginis Mariae 1) </li><br>
            <li>The Rosary, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric prayer. In the sobriety of its elements, it has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety, of which it can be said to be a compendium. It is an echo of the prayer of Mary, her perennial Magnificat for the work of the redemptive Incarnation which began in her virginal womb. With the Rosary, the Christian people sits at the school of Mary and is led to contemplate the beauty on the face of Christ and to experience the depths of his love. Through the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as though from the very hands of the Mother of the Redeemer. </li><br>
          </ol>
        </details></li>
        <br>
        <li>The general suggestions given for Marian celebrations and months may be followed (see 'Marian celebrations'). </li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Plenary Indulgence</span> is obtained by the faithful who pray the rosary (5 decades, with meditation on the mysteries) in the family, church or other gathering of the faithful. (Manual 17.1). In other circumstances, the indulgence is partial.</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Franciscan Crown rosary</span> in honour of the Seven Joys of Mary may be occasionally prayed in churches with a strong Capuchin presence.</li><br>
        <li>The <span class="geninfotitle">rosary may be solemnized</span> in public recitation, through the addition of hymns, Scripture passages, and prayers or meditations related to the mysteries.</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Unity and diversity</span>: public recitation of the rosary should focus on the unity in diversity of our parishes through occasional recitation in multiple languages, different cultural practices, etc.</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Rosary and Eucharistic devotion:</span> it is not forbidden to pray the rosary during Eucharistic Adoration since it is 'a prayer inspired by the Gospel and centered on the mystery of the Incarnation and the Redemption,' and 'a prayer of deep Christological orientation' that can 'direct the attention of the faithful to the worship of Christ the Lord. (cf. CDW 1997, Marialis Cultus 46) .</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Promotion of the rosary</span> as personal and family prayer should be undertaken in sermons, catechesis and pastoral visits to homes during this month .</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">Blessing of rosaries</span> and their distribution may take place in a more solemn celebration, especially on October 7 or at the end of the month (cf. DPP 198, BB 1464).</li><br>
        <li><span class="geninfotitle">The Rosary and the Liturgy</span> complement each other.  The liturgy presents anew the great mysteries of our Redemption. The rosary, by means of devout contemplation, recalls these same mysteries to the mind of the person praying and stimulates the will to draw from them the norms of living.Thus the rosary is an excellent preparation for the liturgy and prolongation of its mysteries (cf. Marialis Cultus 48).

            <li>The Church has always included in the annual cycle the cult of the martyrs and other saints. Raised up to perfection by the manifold grace of God and already in possession of eternal salvation, they sing God's perfect praise in heaven and pray for us. By celebrating their anniversaries, the Church proclaims the achievement of the paschal mystery in the saints who have suffered and who have been glorified with Christ. She proposes them to the faithful as examples who draw all men to the Father through Christ, and through their merits she begs God's favours.The ultimate object of veneration of the Saints is the glory of God and the sanctification of human beings by conforming one's life fully to the divine will and by imitating the virtue of those who were preeminent disciples of the Lord. (DPP 208-209)</li><br>
            <li>The just encounter God in death. He calls them to himself so as to share eternal life with them. No one, however, can be received into God's friendship and intimacy without having been purified of the consequences of personal sin... hence derives the pious custom of suffrage for the souls of the faithful departed, which is an urgent supplication of God to have mercy on the souls of the dead, to purify them by the fire of His charity, and to bring them to His kingdom of light and life. This suffrage is a cultic expression of faith in the communion of saints..These consist, primarily, in the celebration of the holy sacrifice of the Eucharist, and in other pious exercises, such as prayers for the dead, alms deeds, works of mercy, and the application of indulgences to the souls of the faithful departed.

         <ul class="notesdetails">
           <li>The Gospel of the Passion, in the long or short form, may be read or sung by a single person, or by "three persons who take the parts of Christ, the narrator and the people". . When sung, a choir may take the part of the crowd (Paschale Solemnitatis 33, POLT 1).</li><br>
           <li>The passion is proclaimed by three deacons, or if none is present, by priests, or if these are lacking, by lectors; in which case the part of Christ must be reserved for the celebrating priest. (POLT 1) </li><br>
           <li>For the Passion, three bare lecterns are used. Candles and incense are not used. (POLT 2-3)</li><br>
           <li>The Passion is begun immediately: "The Lord be with you" is not said, nor the response. As they begin, the readers do not make the sign of Cross on themselves or the book. When the Passion is finished, the narrator says: "The Gospel of the Lord," and all acclaim: "Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ". The book of the Passion is not kissed by anyone. (PLOT 6, 8-9) </li><br>
           <li>Only the Passion text itself may be sung; no hymns or other musical pieces may be inserted in between. The Passion should not be enacted as a play within the liturgy (cf. PS 33)</li><br>
           <li> The custom of the congregational recitation of parts belonging to the “crowd” is not foreseen by rubrics on the reading of the Passion  in the typical edition of 1989. The text is a Gospel proclamation like all others which the faithful are usually encouraged to actively hear, rather than enact.</li>

       <ul class="notesdetails">
         <li>A Procession with palms to commemorate the Entrance of the Lord into Jerusalem takes place before the principal Mass. When this is not possible, a Solemn Entrance is conducted instead, with the reading of the Gospel, blessing of the palms and hymns as the priest and ministers (and representative faithful/servers) proceed to the altar. This Solemn Entrance may be repeated for other Masses where large numbers of the faithful are present. </li><br>
         <li>At other Masses, a Simple Entrance takes place: this is no different from a regular Mass and palms are not blessed prior to this Mass, although blessed palms may be distributed before or after the celebration.</li><br>
         <li>The priest may wear a cope for the procession or Solemn Entrance, which is changed to a chasuble after kissing (and incensing) the altar. Mass continues with the Lord have mercy (optional) and the Collect.</li><br>
         <li>Where the Mass cannot be celebrated there should be a celebration of the Word of God on the theme of the Lord's messianic entrance and passion, either on Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time. (PS 31; rubric of Roman Missal for Palm Sunday)</li><br>
