<h1>LITURGICAL CALENDAR 2017-8</h1>



<h2>Year B for all Sundays<br>Cycle II during the week</h2>



<div id="menu" style="">







</div>

</div>





<a id="regulations"><h2>Regulations</h2></a>

<ul class="mainlist1">

  <li><b>Holy Days of Obligation</b> on which the faithful are obliged to participate in the celebration of the Eucharist are:

  <ol class="sublist1">

  <li>Sundays or Fridays (where it has been decided);</li>

  <li>the Nativity of the Lord (December 25);</li>

  <li>the Assumption of B.V. Mary (August 15).</li></ol>

    </li>

    <li><b>2017-8 Special Celebration days</b> on which the faithful are encouraged to participate in the celebration of the Eucharist are:

  <ol class="sublist1">

  <li>Immaculate Conception of the B.V. Mary (Dec 8);</li>

  <li>Mary, Mother of God (Jan 1);</li>

  <li>Our Lady of Arabia (Jan 14);</li>

  <li> St. Joseph (March 19);</li>

  <li>Sacred Heart (June 23);</li>

  <li>Ss. Peter and Paul (July 2);</li>

  <li> All Saints (Nov 1);</li>

  <li> Dedication of the Parish Church</li>

  <li> Parish Titular Saint.</li></ol></li>

    <li><b>Observances transferred to the following or preceding Sunday</b> are:

    <ol class="sublist1">

  <li>Epiphany of the Lord;</li>

  <li>Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ (Corpus Christi);</li>

  <li>Ascension of the Lord;</li>

  <li>Ss. Peter and Paul.</li> </ol></li>

    <li><b>Fasting</b> is prescribed for Ash Wednesday and Good Friday for those who have completed 18 years of age and up to the beginning of the 60th year. One meal a day is eaten. Some food may be taken at two other times in the day to maintain strength.</li>

<li><b>Abstinence from meat</b> (milk products, eggs or animal fat not included) applies to those who have completed the 14 years of age. It is prescribed for Ash Wednesday, Good Friday and every Wednesday that is not a Solemnity. However, on Wednesdays outside of Lent, abstinence from meat can be substituted by another act of penance, such as prayer or a work of charity. </li>

<li>During <b>Lenten weekdays and Days of Prayer</b>, abstinence from meat, almsgiving, fasting and other works of prayer, penance and/or charity are encouraged according to ability. </li>

<li><b>Eucharistic Fast</b>: The faithful must abstain from food and drink, aside from water and medicine, for one hour before receiving Holy Communion. The sick, infirm and elderly (and their caregivers) may receive Holy Communion even if they have eaten something within the preceding hour. </li>

<li><b>Paschal (Easter) Precept</b>: The faithful who have made their First Holy Communion should receive Holy Communion at least once a year during the Easter Season. Within the Vicariate, this precept may be fulfilled at any time between the First Sunday of Lent and Trinity Sunday (Sunday after Pentecost). One who has reached the age of discretion is also obliged to confess one’s grave sins at least once a year.</li>

<li><b>General Absolution</b>: may be given on Good Friday and the Midnight Mass(es) of Christmas, if large numbers of parishioners make it impossible for all to avail of the increased opportunities for the sacrament of Reconciliation in the weeks preceding Christmas and Easter. The rite for imparting general absolution may be found in the Rite of Penance, Rite III. The conditions of C.I.C. 962, especially regarding individual confession of grave sins at the next available opportunity, should be clearly announced to the faithful before the absolution is given.</li></ul>





<a id="calendarnotes"><h2>Notes on the Calendar</h2></a>

<ul class="mainlist1">

  <li><b>Saturday Masses:</b> On Saturday morning, the Mass of the day is celebrated.  On Saturday evening, the same Mass that will be celebrated on the following Sunday is used, unless otherwise indicated in this Ordo.  In larger parishes, if a Saturday morning Mass fulfilling the 'Sunday obligation' has been authorized, this Mass also uses the Sunday Mass.</li>

  

  <li><b>Mass formulary used:</b> always follows that of the liturgical day. As a rule, Mass in the morning matches the observance used in the celebration of Lauds (Morning Prayer). Mass in the evening matches the observance used in the celebration of Vespers (Evening Prayer). This Ordo notes the determination made by the Apostolic Vicar in all such instances, especially conflicting celebrations, in accordance with the decree of the Congregation of Divine Worship (cf. Notitiae 10: 222-223).</li>

  <li>The <b>number of readings</b> used on Sundays and Solemnities is 3.  For Feasts falling on Fridays, 3 readings are used in our Vicariate in parish Masses with the people. On all other occasions, only 2 readings are used. When 3 readings are printed in the lectionary for Feasts, a selection may be made between the 1st and 2nd reading, unless it falls on a Sunday or Friday.<br><br>

<b>Special readings</b> from the Proper of Saints are used for Solemnities, Feasts and certain memorials (where one or more of the readings refers directly to the person or mystery celebrated). For other memorials, the regular weekday readings are given in this <i>Ordo</i> since the semi-continuous reading of Scripture is preferred (<i>Introduction to the Lectionary</i> 83, 84). However, on these days, the priest may always exercise the option of selecting readings from the Proper of Saints, or other suitable readings from the appropriate Common.</li>

   <li>An <b>External Solemnity</b> occurs when it desired to celebrate a certain saint more solemnly. The Gloria or Creed may be added, and additional readings chosen from the Proper or Common of Saints.  With the permission of the Bishop, a celebration occurring during the week in Ordinary Time may be moved to the weekend. In Advent, Lent and Easter, such special celebrations may be celebration (with the permission of the Bishop) on Friday, but not on Sunday.</li>

<li><b>Anniversaries</b> of Ordination and Religious Profession may be observed with a special Mass according to the rules laid down for Votive Mass (see Choice of Mass Text). For days on which an Anniversary Masses for the Dead may be celebrated, see Choice of Mass Text.</li>

<li>The <b>Saturday Memorial of the B.V. Mary in Ordinary Time</b>is especially commended in the Vicariate, which is placed under the patronage of our Lady.  A Mass may be selected from (a) the Common of the Virgin Mary (b) a Votive Mass of the B.V. Mary (c) a title of the B.V. Mary in the Universal Calendar or the mystery of the Immaculate Conception (d) a title particularly associated with a certain institute of consecrated life (e) a suitable Mass from the Collection of Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary (or Marian Sacramentary). </li>

<li><b>Common of Saints</b>: the Roman Missal only indicates a suitable text within a Common. Another text within the same Common, or from the Common of Holy Men and Women, may be used. Texts within the same Common (but not from 2 different Commons) may always be interchanged. Necessary alterations to number (singular to plural, or vice versa) and gender may be made to texts from a suggested Common in order to use them for a particular saint.</li></ul>



<hr><hr><h2><a id="advent">ADVENT</a></h2><hr><hr>

<span class="longnote">The Season of Advent begins with First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the First Sunday of Advent (anticipated in the Vicariate on Friday) and ends before First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Christmas.<br><br> 

<i>Advent has a twofold character. It is a time of preparation for Christmas, in which the First Coming of the Son of God to humanity is remembered. It is also a time when, remembering the Incarnation, minds and hearts are led to look forward to Christ’s Second Coming at the end of time. </i> (UNLYC 39). It is <i>a time of waiting, conversion and hope</i> (DPP 96). Advent thus includes an element of penance, both in preparing, quieting and disciplining our hearts for the full joy of Christmas, as well as in preparing our lives to be ready to meet the Lord when he comes again in glory.<br><br>

<b>Liturgical Notes:</b><br>

<ul class="mainlist2">

  <li>The <i>Glory to God</i> is omitted (except on Solemnities, Feasts and Ritual Masses where it is prescribed) but the <i>Alleluia</i> is used.</li>

  

  <li>violet vestments are worn for Masses of Advent weekdays and Sundays. On the Third Sunday of Advent (Gaudete Sunday), rose vestments may be worn.</li>

  

  <li>decoration of the church with flowers, and the use of musical instruments should be curtailed and reduced (cf. IGMR 305, 313). The exceptions are Feasts and Solemnities, and the Third Sunday of Advent (Gaudete Sunday).</li>

  

  <li>the season’s penitential element may be highlighted through more frequent opportunities for the Sacrament of Penance. Communal penance services (with individual confession and absolution) may also be celebrated. Sample services for Advent may be found in Rite of Penance, Appendix II.</li>



<li>the celebration of marriage is not forbidden during Advent, and the Nuptial Mass can be used on all days except Sundays of Advent and Solemnities. However, couples should be counselled to take into account the special nature of the Advent season especially with regard to festivity (OCM 32).</li>



<li>The Marian dimension of the season should be taken into account in hymns and prayers used. The praying of the Angelus should be fostered, especially on weekdays. A more solemn celebration, involving a Gospel reading and other elements (DPP 195) may take place from time to time (see sample in Supplement).</li></ul>

<span class="note"><b>NOTES:</b><br>A <b>Christmas novena</b> may be begun today, where such a practice is customary. The prayers and readings of the Mass and Liturgy of the Hours for these days already form a means of preparation, particularly through the use of the ‘O’ Antiphons.<br> The <i>Directory of Popular Piety</i> encourages that the novena consist of the solemn celebration of Vespers (Evening Prayer); otherwise, the novena should try to reflect the liturgical themes of the days (DPP 103, see <i>Supplement</i> for sample texts). The novena (or novena prayer) is not prayed within the Eucharistic celebration, but before or after – however, if it consists of Vespers, it may be combined, if desired, with the Mass in the manner described in the <i>General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours </i> 94, 96. <br></span></p><hr>



<span style="font-size: smaller; font-weight:bold"> NOTE ON THE CELEBRATION OF THE MISA 'DE AGUINALDO' (SIMBANG GABI):</span><br><br>

<span class="note">The following guidelines, based on those of the Liturgical Commission of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), are suggested for celebrations of the Misa ‘de Aguinaldo’<br>

<span class="number">(a) </span>The Misa de Aguinaldo is celebrated by the Filipino community from December 16 to December 24 (early morning celebrations) or December 15 to December 23 (evening celebrations). Only one such Mass may be celebrated in a church on a given day.<br>

<span class="number">(b) </span>Masses on all days are celebrated in white vestments. The Glory to God (and the Creed for Sunday liturgies) are used. Festive songs may be sung and musical instruments played.<br>

<span class="number">(c) </span>The liturgy of the Sunday always takes precedence. Texts for the appropriate Sunday should be used on Saturday and Sunday evening. (In our Vicariate, they may also be used on Friday.) <br>

<span class="number">(d) </span>On other days, the Mass is taken from either the Proper Masses given for these days in the <i>Filipino Proper</i> of the <i>Roman Missal</i>; or from the <i>Common of the Blessed Virgin Mary: In Advent</i>. A suitable Advent Mass from the <i>Collection of Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary</i> may also be chosen. <br>

<span class="number">(e) </span>Readings are taken from the readings of the day. The first day of Simbang Gabi may use the readings of the Friday in the 3rd week of Advent. <br></span><hr>

<span class="longnote">Christmas Time runs from First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the Nativity of the Lord up to and including the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. The Christmas season is one of joy and celebration. After the annual celebration of the Paschal Mystery, the Church has no more ancient custom than celebrating the memorial of the Nativity of the Lord and of his first manifestations (UNLYC 32).<br><br> 

<b>Liturgical Notes:</b><br>

<ul class="mainlist2">

  <li>white vestments are worn throughout the Christmas Season, except for the observances of martyrs, when red vestments are used. </li>

  

  <li>each of the days within the Christmas Octave, as well as the weekdays before and after the Epiphany, have a proper Mass. Memorials of the saints occurring during the Christmas Octave are only commemorated. Throughout the Octave, the proper form for the Nativity of the <i>In communion</i> is used in Eucharistic Prayer I</li>

  

  <li>The Christmas Season offers the opportunity for many blessings, including homes (especially around Epiphany, BB 1597-1621), a manger/nativity scene (BB 1541-1569), Christmas tree (BB 1570-1596) and other persons or items, mentioned in their proper places below</li></ul>

<hr><hr><h2><a id="eastertime">EASTER SEASON</a></h2><hr><hr>

<span class="longnote">All the 50 days of the Easter Season, beginning with the Vigil of Easter and concluding with Pentecost Sunday are celebrated as one feast day, the “great Sunday”.<br><br>

<b>Liturgical Notes:</b><br><br>

<ul class="mainlist2">

  <li>Masses during the Easter Octave and on Pentecost end with the double alleluia in the dismissal.</li>

    <li>During the Easter Season, the alleluia is added to the Entrance and Communion antiphons of Ritual and Votive Masses, as appropriate. In verse-and-responses used in liturgical and paraliturgical settings (e.g. 'You have given them bread from heaven', 'Pray for us holy Mother of God', etc.), the alleluia is added.</li>

   <li>The Paschal Candle is kept by the ambo or the altar until Pentecost Day. At all solemn liturgical celebrations during the season (e.g. Masses during the Easter Octave, Sundays, Solemnities and even Feasts), it should be lit.</li>

  <li>The Angelus (The angel of the Lord) is replaced by the Regina caeli, laetare (Queen of heaven, rejoice). On special occasions, the solemn form with a Gospel reading (DPP 196) may be used.</li>

<li>It is encouraged that the blessing and sprinkling of water replace the Penitential Act at Masses on Sundays and festive occasions during the Easter Season. In such a case, the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy) is omitted, and the Mass continues after the sprinkling with the Gloria (Glory to God)</li>

<li>Mystagogic Catechesis may take place for the newly baptized. When possible, at least at a designated Mass, the newly baptized may be seated in a special place throughout the Easter Season (PS 103), along with their godparents. At least on Sundays of the Easter Season, the General Intercessions should include a petition for all the newly baptized, as local circumstances allow.</li>

<li> On weekdays, the Responsorial Psalm followed by the Alleluia may be replaced by the Alleluia Psalm (IGMR 62), where Alleluia forms the refrain between the psalm verses. </li>

<li> The blessing of homes is appropriately done by priests and deacons after the Solemnity of Easter (BB 1601-1621). It is appropriate that the blessed baptismal water of Easter be used. It is also possible that several families may be gathered together for such a blessing. Pastoral visitation of families during this period is encouraged.</li>

<li>Wherever possible, the celebration of First Communions on one of the Sundays of Easter, to highlight the baptismal and paschal character of the sacrament, is encouraged (PS 103). Similarly, the celebration of infant baptisms is also encouraged during the Easter Season, especially on Sundays </li></ul></span>

  <li>Eucharistic Prayer IV has many characteristics (e.g. summary of salvation history) that commend its use on the Sundays of Ordinary Time. Six forms of Solemn Blessing are given for Ordinary Time (nn. 9-14) and fittingly used on Sundays.  </li>

  

  <li>Weekdays use the formulary of the preceding Sunday.

Suitable suffrage for the dead encouraged by the Church may be mentioned and recommended - such suffrage includes alms alms, works of mercy, fasting, gaining indulgences for the dead, daily recitation of prayers or invocations for the dead [e.g. at the Angelus, rosary and prayers before meals] and other forms of piety especially in the month of November (DPP 260).</span></p><hr>

<a id="mariandevotion"><h2>FORMS OF MARIAN DEVOTION</h2></a>



<p>The forms of devotion mentioned here are drawn from the <i>Guidelines and Proposals for a Marian Year</i> (GMY), issued by the Congregation of Divine Worship in 1987 and commended by the <i>Directory of Popular Piety</i>. They are especially suitable for periods dedicated to the Virgin Mary (e.g.  the months of May and October).</p>



<p><b>MASS:</b><br>

<ol class="sublist2">

  <li>the use of the “I confess” (Form A) mentioning the Blessed Virgin, or (if using Form C) invocations mentioning the link between Christ and Mary.</li>

    <li>concluding the Mass with a Marian antiphon or hymn reflective of the liturgical season (GMY 21)</li>

  <li>making a mention of the intercession of the Blessed Virgin in the petitions or Concluding Prayer of the Prayers of the Faithful (GMY 18)</li>

  <li>celebrating the Saturday Memorial of the Blessed Virgin during Ordinary Time. Public Marian novenas may also be preceded or followed by an appropriate Marian Mass.</li></ol>



<b>SACRAMENTS</b><br>

<ol class="sublist2">

  <li>Baptism: the invocation of Our Lady in the Litany, the solemn singing/recitation of the Magnificat at the conclusion of the rite, and presenting the child at the altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Rite of Baptism 51).</li>

    <li>First Holy Communion and Confirmation: preparation could highlight the Marian parallels of these sacraments (e.g. baptismal regeneration and the Immaculate Conception, the Mary-Church parallel in birth of Christ and rebirth of Christians, the presence of the Blessed Virgin at Pentecost, etc.). (GMY 23-28). Focus could be laid on how traditional titles emphasize the role of the Blessed Virgin in themes of enmity to sin, discipleship and evangelization.  Candidates may be entrusted/’consecrated’ to the Virgin Mary in order to imitate her perfect discipleship.</li>

  <li>Reconciliation: using concluding prayers mentioning the B.V. Mary (e.g. "May the Passion of our Lord..."), and recommending recourse to her as part of the penance imposed.</li>

  <li>Anointing of the Sick: the use of litanies and prayers of the Blessed Virgin given as options in the rites for the sick and dying.</li>

  <li>Marriage: legitimate customs that honour the Blessed Virgin, such as the presentation of the nuptial bouquet, or joint prayer of the couple before a Marian image before or after the ceremony.</li></ol>

    



<b>EUCHARISTIC ADORATION</b><br>

<ol class="sublist2">

  <li>using hymns, antiphons and closing prayers (given in Eucharistic Worship outside Mass) that link the Eucharist and the Blessed Virgin (e.g. <i>Ave Verum Corpus</i> – Hail true Body) are encouraged.</li>

    <li>Solemn Marian devotions may conclude with Eucharistic Benediction which is regarded as “a legitimate expression of Marian devotion and an orientation of the faithful towards worship of Christ the Redeemer” (GMY 29)</li>

  <li>Marian prayers with a Christological focus, such as the rosary, may be used; or meditations given on the Blessed Sacrament highlighting Marian virtues and themes.</li> </ol>



<b>BLESSINGS:</b><br>

<ol class="sublist2">

  <li>in the blessing of homes, vehicles, etc. a rosary and/or an image of the Blessed Virgin may also be blessed, and families/person(s) placed under her protection (GMY 45). Practices such as the Enthronement of the Immaculate Heart are also fittingly retained</li>

    <li>blessing of women before and after childbirth, and of families and children, making use of the options that mention the Blessed Virgin.</li>

  <li>blessing of Marian objects (e.g. rosaries, scapulars, etc.)</li>

    <li>when blessing persons or gatherings, a suitable invocation to the B.V. mary may conclude the prayers of intercession, and a Marian prayer conclude the whole celebration, wherever such a practice is in harmony with the liturgical text</li> </ol>



<b>DEVOTIONS:</b><br>

<ol class="sublist2">

  <li>the public recitation of the <i>Angelus</i> and the <i>Regina Caeli</i>, on occasion in a more solemn form with Gospel reading and Collect</li>

    <li>the public praying of the Holy Rosary. It may be solemnized through the addition of appropriate prayers and hymns. In the churches in which there is a strong Capuchin presence, the occasional praying of the Franciscan Crown rosary could also be encouraged.</li>

  <li>novenas, litanies, processions, paraliturgical services and other forms of Marian devotion</li>

  <li>placing an image of the Blessed Virgin, appropriately decorated, for public veneration in the church. Care should be taken that it does not detract from the honour due to the Blessed Sacrament (especially when exposed) and harmonizes with seasonal liturgical symbols (e.g. Paschal Candle during Easter)</li>

If several celebrations fall on the same day, the one that holds the highest rank according to the Table of Liturgical Days is observed. However, a Solemnity impeded by a liturgical day that takes precedence over it should be transferred to the closest day not listed under nos. 1-8 in the Table of Precedence. In the Vicariate of Southern Arabia, in order to ensure the observance of the Sunday liturgies integral to certain seasons, Solemnities that fall on a weekend of Advent, Lent or Easter are transferred to the preceding Thursday or following Monday, according to the indications given by the Apostolic Vicar and noted in this Ordo. Other celebrations are omitted in that year.



Should  Vespers (Evening Prayer) of the current day’s Office and First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the following day be assigned for celebration on the same day, then Vespers (Evening Prayer) of the celebration with the higher rank in the Table of Liturgical Days takes precedence; in cases of equal rank, Vespers (Evening Prayer) of the current day takes precedence.<br><br>
